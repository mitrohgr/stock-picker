## Self-reflections

> It took quite some time to reach here. I always keep the stuff I learnt about motivation and mindset in the beginning part of the odin project close to my heart. It has proved valuable in overcoming many of the challenges that I've faced as of now.

> This was actually one of the easiest projects. I learned a whole lot about installing Ruby and all the different basic Ruby tidbits prior to starting this project. The only time spent was brainstorming how to actually find the best day to buy and sell. I believe that the "quick tips" provided are enough to solve this exercise. Take your time and don't ever rush.
